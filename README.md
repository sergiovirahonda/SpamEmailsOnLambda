# Spam emails predictor ready to be deployed to AWS Lambda.
This is a previous project already shared here but this time adapted to run on top of AWS Lambda.
The whole project with its Jupyter notebook file is available at https://github.com/sergiovirahonda/SpamAssasin-NLP

If you want to deploy it, al what you need to do is to configure your AWS credentials with aws configure command, then run sls deploy and that's it.

Feel free to check the code out and if it has something of your interest, just bookmark the repo :)
